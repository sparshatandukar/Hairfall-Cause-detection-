Hair and Scalp disease detection
Hair loss and scalp-related diseases significantly impact individuals' well-being, yet early diagnosis remains a challenge. Traditional 
methods rely on dermatologists performing visual and medical tests, often leading to delayed treatment. Recent advancements in deep learning
and image processing have facilitated automated disease detection, particularly in healthcare applications such as cancer and tumor diagnosis.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated high accuracy in medical imaging, making them suitable for identifying dermatological conditions.
Previous studies have attempted to address these challenges through image preprocessing techniques, including denoising and enhancement. 
The effectiveness of deep learning in classifying conditions like alopecia, psoriasis, and folliculitis highlights its potential for aiding early detection.

Diagonising and treating hair loss
This research explains that the hair loss can have a significant emotional impact on patients, necessitating careful evaluation and management by physicians.
It presents in various forms, including focal and diffuse patterns. Focal hair loss is categorized into scarring and nonscarring types, with scarring alopecia
requiring dermatological evaluation. Male and female pattern baldness follow distinct patterns and respond to treatments like topical minoxidil,
with finasteride being an option for men. Diffuse alopecia areata, though less common, should also be considered in such cases. Understanding these patterns
aids in effective diagnosis and treatment, improving patient outcomes.

Hair loss is a widespread issue affecting both men and women, with an increasing number of cases among females. Studies indicate that genetic predisposition, 
dandruff, allergies, and stress are key contributors to hair fall. Various machine learning approaches have been applied to predict and analyze hair loss patterns.
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
and XGBoost have been widely used in medical diagnostics and classification tasks. Prior research highlights that ensemble methods,
such as XGBoost, often outperform traditional models due to their ability to handle complex data structures and enhance predictive accuracy. 
Machine learning has proven effective in analyzing survey-based datasets, offering new insights into hair loss prediction and contributing to 
personalized treatment strategies.

dermatological conditions. CNNs have demonstrated their potential in recognizing patterns and anomalies in images, enabling early detection of hair and scalp diseases.
The integration of technology in healthcare systems offers promising prospects for improving patient care, empowering both healthcare professionals and patients
through timely, accessible solutions. This growing synergy between AI and healthcare has the potential to revolutionize dermatological diagnostics and contribute
to global healthcare advancements.

Hair Follicle Classification and Hair Loss Severity Estimation Using Mask R-CNN
The literature on hair loss detection has evolved significantly with the use of deep learning techniques, though challenges remain in accurately assessing hair loss
severity. Early detection of scalp hair loss is essential for effective treatment and reducing medical costs. While many deep learning approaches have been developed
for hair loss detection, the robustness and accuracy of severity assessment remain significant barriers to practical application. Previous methods have focused on
image processing, but accuracy improvements are needed. The use of Mask R-CNN for hair follicle classification and severity estimation offers a more efficient and
accurate approach compared to existing methods, showing an enhancement of 4 to 15% in classification accuracy. This suggests its potential application in clinical
settings to improve hair loss diagnosis and prognosis.
